# Chuck Norris Joke Generator

*We want an Application where we can fetch 10 Random Chuck Norris jokes. These jokes can be fetched
from the following API <http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/10>.
When these jokes are fetched via a button they need to be displayed in a list. In this list we can mark
certain jokes as favourite. The favourite jokes will appear in a favourites list with a max of 10 unique items.
There should be an option to remove jokes from the favourite list as well.
On refresh the favourites lists should be stored so next time when i visit the app my favourites should be
present.
We can also turn a timer on/off via a button (every 5 seconds). This will add one random joke to the
favourites list <http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/1> until the list has 10 items.*
